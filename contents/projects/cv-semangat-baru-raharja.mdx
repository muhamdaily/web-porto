## The Story Behind CV Semangat Baru Raharja

CV. Semangat Baru Raharja is a trusted local FMCG distributor that has successfully served the Jember and Bondowoso regions. Handling a wide range of fast-moving consumer goods—such as snacks, biscuits, staple foods, and household products—requires accurate data management and efficient distribution workflows.

With more than 10 principals trusting the company as their sole distributor, operational reliability is critical. This project was built to support that responsibility by digitizing key processes, enabling better coordination between sales, distribution, and management teams. The system is designed to handle diverse customer segments, from retail and wholesale stores to modern markets and industrial clients such as UMKM, cafés, hotels, and restaurants.
