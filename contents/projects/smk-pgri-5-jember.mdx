## The Story Behind SMK PGRI 5 Jember Website

Many school websites still struggle with outdated designs, unclear information structure, and poor accessibility across devices. SMK PGRI 5 Jember needed a digital platform that could represent the school professionally while also being easy to manage and user-friendly.

This project was developed to centralize school information in one reliable system—making it easier for students and parents to stay informed, and for administrators to manage content efficiently. The focus was not only on functionality, but also on clarity, performance, and long-term maintainability.
