## The Story Behind Khatulistiwa Coffee

Khatulistiwa Coffee is a subsidiary of **PT Iskandar Gurrindo International**, founded based on a strong passion for Indonesian coffee. Indonesia produces some of the finest coffee beans in the world, yet many people have not fully experienced their true quality and flavor.

By sourcing coffee beans directly from local farmers, Khatulistiwa Coffee ensures natural taste, freshness, and consistent quality. This project was built to translate that philosophy into a professional digital presence—introducing Indonesian coffee to a global audience through a clean, informative, and reliable website.
