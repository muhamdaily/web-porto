## The Story Behind Smart Ribbed Smoked Sheet Drying System

Traditional rubber smoking processes often rely on manual monitoring, which can lead to inconsistent temperatures, humidity levels, and drying durations. These inconsistencies may affect the final quality of the ribbed smoked sheet and reduce operational efficiency.

This project was developed to integrate IoT technology into the rubber drying workflow. By collecting real-time data from on-site sensors, the system allows operators to monitor conditions and automatically adjust temperature, humidity, and smoking duration based on predefined parameters. The result is a more controlled, data-driven process that improves product consistency while reducing human error.
