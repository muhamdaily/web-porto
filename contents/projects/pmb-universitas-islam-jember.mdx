## The Story Behind PMB Universitas Islam Jember

Traditional student admission processes often rely on manual data collection, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Universitas Islam Jember needed a centralized digital solution to manage prospective student data more effectively while improving accessibility for applicants.

This project was developed to support a fully online admission workflow—from registration to data management—helping the university streamline operations and provide a better experience for prospective students. The system focuses on reliability, data accuracy, and ease of use for both applicants and administrators.
