## The Story Behind PPDB SMK PGRI 5 Jember

The new student admission process in many schools is still handled manually, making data management inefficient and prone to errors. SMK PGRI 5 Jember required a reliable digital system to manage applicant data while improving accessibility for students and parents.

This project was developed to centralize the entire PPDB workflow into a single web platform—helping administrators manage registration data more effectively and allowing applicants to complete the process anytime and anywhere. The system emphasizes simplicity, data accuracy, and operational efficiency.
