## The Story Behind CV Madju Jaya

Managing tetes distribution involves complex workflows, including factory shipments, farmer payments, transaction records, and financial calculations. Previously, these processes were difficult to track accurately and efficiently using manual or fragmented systems.

This project was developed to centralize all operational and financial data into a single platform. By presenting key metrics, summaries, and transaction details in a clear dashboard interface, the system helps management make informed decisions while improving transparency and operational efficiency.

The platform focuses on accuracy, usability, and scalability—ensuring it can support long-term business operations.
